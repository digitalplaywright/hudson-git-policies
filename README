The purpose of this git hook is to support a special central git repository
where 
  1. Only a continuous integration tool can merge changes with master
  2. Users can only push to their own prefix branches on the central 
     git repository

The purpose of this is that users can take advantage of distributed version 
control while developing, but safely share and integrate changes on a 
central git repository. 

Since only the continuous integration tool can merge with master we can
safely assume that master is always passing all tests.
      
A prefix branch is a on the form
    prefix-name
where prefix is the username returned by 'whoami' and the name can be any 
arbitrary string. A user can pull from master or any prefix branch, but
can only push to a branch prefixed with his own username.

In this script we assume that the continuous integration tool is running 
under a user called 'hudson', but it is trivial to change this.
